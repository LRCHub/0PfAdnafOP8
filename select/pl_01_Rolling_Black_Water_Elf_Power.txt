Down by the shoreline, down by
the sea
Rolling black water, singing me
to sleep
Keeps rushing forward, keeps
rushing by
Rolling black water keep me
inside
Out of the warm night, into the
trees
Rolling black water, sing me to
sleep
Send me a raincloud, tell me
goodbye
Rolling black water, keep me
alive
